To best guide you, I need a little more information about where you are now and where you want to be.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Your Current State**\n\nCould you please tell me about your background?  This includes your current role, experience level, and the industries you've worked in. It would also be incredibly helpful if you could paste your resume or key information (experience, skills, education) into the chat.  (File uploads aren't supported yet, so pasting is best).\n\n**Step 2: Understand Your Target**\n\nWhat's your target job role, company, industry, or level?  If you have a job description for a role you're interested in, please paste that in as well - it's optional but will be very useful for our analysis.",

Targeting entry-level APM roles at top tech companies like Google is ambitious, but achievable with the right preparation.\n\nTo tailor a roadmap specifically for you, I need some more details.\n\n**Step 1: Deep Dive into Your Current State**\n\nCan you please share more about your communications work experience?  What were your responsibilities, what did you achieve, and what skills did you develop? Also, which areas within Computer Science are you focusing on during your master's program?  Pasting relevant parts of your resume or listing your key skills and projects would be highly beneficial.\n\n**Step 2: Refine Your Target**\n\nWhile aiming for Google is excellent, having a few other target companies in mind is always a good strategy.  Do you have any other companies you're considering?  Also, if you can find a job description for an Associate Product Manager role at Google (or a similar company), pasting it here would be incredibly valuable.  It will help us pinpoint the specific skills and experiences they're looking for.",
