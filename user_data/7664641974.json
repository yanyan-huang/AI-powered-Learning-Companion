However, I can share a few general tips:\n\n1. **Research and Preparation:** Before an interview, research the company, its products, and the market it operates in. This will help you answer questions about launching products, responding to trends, and defining go-to-market strategies.\n\n2. **Structure Your Answers:** When answering, try to structure your response. For example, you could start by defining the problem, then propose a solution, and finally discuss how you would implement it and measure success.\n\n3. **Practice:** The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with these types of questions. Don't be discouraged if you find them challenging at first.\n\nRemember, the goal of these interviews is to assess your ability to think strategically and make data-driven decisions. Keep practicing and you'll improve over time. \n\nWould you like to try another interview type, revisit a specific question, or head to Coach Mode to break down product concepts further?",
