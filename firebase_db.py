This module initializes the Firebase Firestore database connection.
It uses the Firebase Admin SDK to authenticate and access the Firestore database.
It requires a service account key in JSON format for authentication.
The service account key should be stored in a file named 'firebase_creds.json'.
The database connection is established using the credentials from the service account key.
The Firestore client is created and can be used to perform database operations.
